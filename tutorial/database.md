# Work with Database
One common use case is to load spreadsheet data from your database and save it back after editing. There are 2 ways to interact with a database:
1. Import/Export an xlsx file from/to your database: <br/>
**Import**: please reference the previous section [Online Editor](https://doc.keikai.io/tutorial/first) where you can import xlsx file via the API. <br/>
**Export**: All information of a book model can be exported to an .xlsx file. You can store the file in a [BLOB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_large_object) field of a table in a database.
2. Populate/Store cell data from/to your database: <br/>
**Populate data into spreadsheet**: When displaying data from the database, you can publish data with `Range` setter methods into Keikai cells.<br/>
**Store data into database**: Extract cell data or formulas you need with `Range` getter method and insert them into a corresponding database table. 

The example we introduce below demonstrates the 2nd way: using `Range` API to save the cell data back to the database and publish a table's data to cells. The architecture is as follows:

# Range API
For each cell/row/column operation via API, you need to get a `Range` object first. It could represent one or more cells, a row, a column, a sheet, or a book. Just like you need to select a cell with your mouse in a sheet. 

The helper class `Ranges` supports various methods to create a `Range` object like:

```java
// a book
Ranges.range(spreadsheet.getBook());
// a sheet
Ranges.range(spreadsheet.getSelectedSheet());
// a row
Ranges.range(spreadsheet.getSelectedSheet(), "A1").toRowRange();
// a cell
Ranges.range(spreadsheet.getSelectedSheet(),  3, 3);
// multiple cells
Ranges.range(spreadsheet.getSelectedSheet(), "A1:B4");
Ranges.range(spreadsheet.getSelectedSheet(), 0, 0, 3, 1);
```
Getting a `Range` for one cell requires a sheet, row index, and column index as the coordinate, and multiple cells requires starting and end row/column index.

With all these information, you can call `Range`'s method to performe an action like `setValue()` or `getValue()`.


# Background
Assume you wish to display a database table in a predefined format. This can be done by preparing an Excel template, load the template into Keikai, and then populate the data from database to the template.

Refer to the following screenshot, on the right hand side there is a database table. On the left hand side, it's Keikai that loads the data from the table into an xlsx template:

![](/assets/images/tutorial/databaseExample.png)

An end user can:
* edit cells and save back to the database
* reload the data from the database

## Persistence Layer Classes
To make thing easy to understand, we create a class `MyDataService` to handle query and update for the (simulated) database. It can query a collection of `Trade` for us to populate into Keikai and save `Trade` into the database.

In your real application, you can implement your own persistence layer classes according to your preference. There's no limitation here, you can use Hibernate or JDBC or any Java solutions you like.


# Build the UI
We build the page above in ([database.zul](https://github.com/keikai/keikai-tutorial/blob/master/src/main/webapp/database.zul)) with various ZK components, please refer to [ZK Component Refrence](http://books.zkoss.org/wiki/ZK_Component_Reference) to know its details.


# Controller
Keikai supports the well-known pattern, [MVC (Model-View-Controller)](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/uiArchs.html#ModelViewController), and it plays as the role of **View**. The domain data from the database is referred to as **Model**. We have to create a **Controller** to control Keikai. The controller for Keikai is a Java class that extends `SelectorComposer`, and it interacts with the database via `MyDataService`. 

```java
public class DatabaseComposer extends SelectorComposer<Component> {

    private MyDataService dataService = new MyDataService();
    @Wire
    private Spreadsheet ss;
 ...   
}
```
* With [`@Wire`](https://www.zkoss.org/wiki/ZK%20Developer's%20Reference/MVC/Controller/Wire%20Components) on a member field, the underlying ZK framework can inject `Spreadsheet` object created according to the zul. You don't need to create it by yourself.

## Apply on the page
We need to link `DatabaseComposer` with the previous page, so that the controller can listen to events and controll components via API. 

Specify the full-qualified class name at `apply` attribute, then Keikai will instatiate it automaticaly when you visit the page. The controller can contoller the root component, `<hlayout>`, and all its children components (those inner tags).

```xml
<hlayout width="100%" vflex="1" apply="io.keikai.tutorial.database.DatabaseComposer">
...
    <spreadsheet />
<hlayout>
```


## Listen Events
There are 2 buttons on the page that we need to listen to their click event and implement related application logic. Specify 2 buttons' id so that you can easily listen to events of them.

```xml
<button id="save" label="Save to Database" />
<button id="load" label="Load from Database" disabled="true"/>
```

Put [@Listen](https://www.zkoss.org/wiki/ZK_Developer%27s_Reference/Event_Handling/Event_Listening#Composer_and_Event_Listener_Autowiring) on your event listener method with CSS selector-like syntax below. That means you want to listen `onClick` event on `#load` which represents a component whose ID is `load`. For more syntax, please refer to [`SelectorComposer` javadoc](http://www.zkoss.org/javadoc/latest/zk/org/zkoss/zk/ui/select/SelectorComposer.html). Therefore, when a user clicks "Load from Database" button, `DatabaseComposer::load()` will be invoked.


```java
//Load from Database
@Listen("onClick = #load")
public void load(){
    reload();
    ...
}

//Save to Database
@Listen("onClick = #save")
public void save(){
    dataService.save(modifiedTrades);
    ...
}
```
Then, you can implement related application logic in each listener according to your requirements.


## Populate Data into Cells
After you query one or more `Trade` from the database, you can populate it into the target cells with `Range` setter:

```java
//column index
public static int ID = 0;
public static int TYPE = 1;
public static int SALESPERSON = 2;
public static int SALES = 3;
...
private void load(Trade trade, int row) {
    Sheet sheet = ss.getSelectedSheet();
    Ranges.range(sheet, row, ID).setCellValue(trade.getId());
    Ranges.range(sheet, row, TYPE).setCellValue(trade.getType());
    Ranges.range(sheet, row, SALESPERSON).setCellValue(trade.getSalesPerson());
    Ranges.range(sheet, row, SALES).setCellValue(trade.getSale());
}
```


## Save Data into a Table
Before you save a `Trade`, you need to extract user input from cells with getter. You still need a `Range` but you will call getter this time like:

```java
private Trade extract(int row ){
    Sheet sheet = ss.getSelectedSheet();
    Trade trade = new Trade(extractInt(Ranges.range(sheet, row, ID)));
    trade.setType(Ranges.range(sheet, row, TYPE).getCellEditText());
    trade.setSalesPerson(Ranges.range(sheet, row, SALESPERSON).getCellEditText());
    trade.setSale(extractInt(Ranges.range(sheet, row, SALES)));
    return trade;
}

private int extractInt(Range cell){
    CellData cellData = cell.getCellData();
    return cellData.getDoubleValue() == null ? 0 : cellData.getDoubleValue().intValue();
}
```
* Beware - if a cell is blank, `getYYYValue()` of `CellData` returns null.


# Summary
* This example demonstrates how you can use Keikai API to load data from the database to a spreadsheet and save it back.
* You can use any Java framework/library to communicate with the database, it is not limited by Keikai.
