# Use Keikai
You can manipulate Keikai in two ways â€“ via spreadsheet UI (with a browser) or via spreadsheet Java API. In this section we will be talking about using spreadsheet UI.

## Spreadsheet UI
Using Keikai spreadsheet with your browser is just like using Excel or Google Sheet. From top to bottom, there is a toolbar, a formula bar, a sheet, and a worksheet tab. Anyone can pick it up easily and start editing in the way he or she is used to, without having to read a user manual.

You can move the focus with arrow keys, enter text, numbers, or formulas in a cell, click buttons on the toolbar, and switch sheets.

## Hotkeys
The current supported hotkeys are:

* **Ctrl-C**  | Copy
* **Ctrl-X**  | Cut
* **Ctrl-V**  | Paste
* **Ctrl-Z**  | Undo
* **Ctrl-Y**  | Redo
* **Delete** | Clear Content
* **Esc**    | Clear or Copy/Cut Clipboard
* **Shift + Up/Down/Left/Right** | Update Selection
* **Ctrl + Up/Down/Left/Right**  | Move the Focus to the Edge


## Load an xlsx File
When visiting a page with Keikai spreadsheet in your browser, it gives you a blank sheet. If you wish to load your existing Excel file or template for further editing, it can be easily done by clicking the upload button in the toolbar.

## Upload
The easiest way to import a file is to click the upload button in the toolbar to upload an xlsx file. Note that xlsx is the only format that Keikai accepts.
