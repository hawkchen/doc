# Create a Translation for UI Text

By default, Keikai only displays English on its user interface. You can create your language translation file for UI texts to make it more user-friendly. Keikai stores its UI text in a JavaScript and a properties file.

## Create a JavaScript File for a Language

### Clone the Built-in js
Clone the default UI text language js property file, `keikai.jar/web/js/zss/lang/msgzss.js`, to make a new language js file for a specific locale like:

`msgzss_[LANG]_[COUNTRY].js`

e.g. `msgzss_zh_TW.js` is for traditional Chinese in Taiwan.

Put the language js file under the below path in your class-path like:

`/WEB-INF/classes/web/js/zss/lang/msgzss_zh_TW.js`

In Maven default folder structure, you need to put it under `resources`.


### Translate to Target Language

Replacing string values (English) with the target language. 

```js
msgzss = {
    cannotEditProtected: "無法編輯受保護的儲存格"
};
msgzss.action = {
    sheet: "工作表",
    addSheet: "新增",
    addCol: "新增一欄",
    addRow: "新增一列",
    showSheets: "顯示",
    deleteSheet: "刪除",
    copySheet: "複製",
    renameSheet: "更名",
    moveSheetLeft: "左移",
    moveSheetRight: "右移",
    homePanel: "Home",
    formulaPanel: "公式",
    insertPanel: "插入",
    newBook: "新檔案",
    ...
}
```

Then, visit a page with a browser in the corresponding language setting.
The result looks like:

![]({{site.devref_image_folder}}/chinese-toolbar.png)
![]({{site.devref_image_folder}}/chinese-contextmenu.png)
![]({{site.devref_image_folder}}/chinese-sheet-contextmenu.png)


## Create a Properties File for a Language
Those UI text for the dialogs generated from the server-side stores in a properties:

`keikai-ex.jar/metainfo/zk-label.properties`

Clone this file to make a new language properties file for a specific locale like:

`zk-label_[LANG]_[COUNTRY].properties`

e.g. `zk-label_zh_TW.properties` 

Translate those property values and put the file under `/WEB-INF/`. Then ZK will load it automatically.

# Client-side Rendering Message

Since keikai, we replace the rendering message with a moving red dots animation.
