The easiest way to run your first Keikai spreadsheet is to follow the [Tutorial](/tutorial). The tutorial project contains several basic examples and will automatically pull all required packages for you. You will be able to play with Keikai locally in just a few minutes. 

If you wish to work with a more complete example, refer to the next section [Keikai App]({{site.devref}}/Spreadsheet_App).
