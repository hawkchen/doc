# Copy & Paste
Keikai currently doesn't support to paste content copied from an external application (e.g. Excel, text editor) via UI below:
* "Paste" button on the toolbar
* "paste" item in the context menu

It will show a warning:
`Please use shortcut âŒ˜V to paste what you cut or copied.`

Because a browser needs user-granted permission to access system clipboard.

* Ctrl+X | Cut
* Ctrl+V | Paste
* Ctrl+Z | Undo
* Ctrl+Y | Redo
* Ctrl+A | select all / selects the current region that contains data

# Exceeding Maximal Column Warning
When you insert a column, if you see the alert:

`This operation cannot work because it will push non-empty cells out of the worksheet.`

That means there is data at the far right of your worksheet, and inserting columns will push the data out of the maximal column. Therefore, Keikai prevents you from inserting.

**Solution:**
Remove the data at the far right of your worksheet.
