# Copy & Paste
Keikai currently doesn't support to paste content copied from an external application (e.g. Excel, text editor) via UI below:
* "Paste" button on the toolbar
* "paste" item in the context menu

It will show a warning:
`Please use shortcut âŒ˜V to paste what you cut or copied.`

Because a browser needs user-granted permission to access system clipboard.

* Ctrl+X | Cut
* Ctrl+V | Paste

* Ctrl+A | select all / selects the current region that contains data
