# Customize Form Control Style
Each form control is an HTML element that has its own CSS class, so you can customize their style by overriding rules of their CSS class e.g. `.k-ctrl-button`

## For a specific button
Keikai also generates a CSS class upon a button's name in lower case for a button. For example, if a button's is `Button 1`, keikai will generate a CSS class, `button-1`, on the button.
