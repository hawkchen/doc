Keikai spreadsheet can also be embedded in a JSP by spreadsheet custom tag
to empower JSP with AJAX. Spreadsheet JSP tag works much the same way as
Keikai spreadsheet ZUL component tag does within a ZK application with
support for all the attributes and events. You can just download the
example project to experience it. Furthermore, if you want a DOM element
can interact with Spreadsheet, you can send your own AJAX request in
Javascript or use <http://jquery.com>. Then handle AJAX request by
yourself with Spreadsheet API we mentioned in [ Working with
Spreadsheet](ZK_Spreadsheet_Essentials_3/Working_with_Spreadsheet "wikilink").
We will demonstrate the usage with an example application.
